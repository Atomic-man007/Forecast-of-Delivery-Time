# Forecast-of-Delivery-Time
Forecasting delivery time using python and its libraries

## Importand things to take into account

**Collect data**: Gather historical data on deliveries, including the time it took to deliver the
package, the distance traveled, traffic conditions, weather conditions, and any other relevant factors. Ensure that the data is clean and in a suitable format for analysis.

**Split the data**: Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

**Define the model**: Define a linear regression model using TensorFlow. The model should take the input variables and predict the delivery time.

**Train the model**: Train the model using the training set. Use an appropriate loss function and optimizer to minimize the error between the predicted and actual delivery times.

**Evaluate the model**: Evaluate the performance of the model using the testing set. Use metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared to assess the accuracy of the model.

**Fine-tune the model**: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

**Make predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data. Provide the input variables such as distance, traffic, weather, and other relevant factors, and the model will predict the delivery time.

Overall, linear regression and TensorFlow can be powerful tools for forecasting delivery times. By training a model on historical data and using it to make predictions, companies can improve their delivery performance and provide a better experience for their customers.
